4,08/Oct/2022 00:00:00,09/Oct/2022 09:43:12,Why Oyo Ipo Would Be One Of The Biggest Ever Scam In The History Of Indian Startup Eco System Oyo Ipo Would Fail Badly Due To Scams Money Laundering,"Why Oyo Ipo Would Be One Of The Biggest Ever Scam In The History Of Indian Startup Eco System Oyo Ipo Would Fail Badly Due To Scams Money Launderingherein Is A Cautionary Approach To Retail Investors Who Might Be Excited To Buy Oyo S Ipo If You Might Be One Of Them, Read Before You Invest Oyo Hotels Has Learnt To Stay In The Limelight And Garner Headlines, Whether It Is Via The Ipo Way Or With The Grand Plans, It Has On Its Shelves And Just Waiting To Execute The Same However, For Oyo, The Opportunity Just Doesn T Add Up Either It Is The Market Downturn That Affects Its Plans, Or It Is The Decision Of The Management To Adopt A More Cautionary Approach Waiting For The Right Moment To Strike Those Who Might Not Be Familiar With The Growth Story Of Oyo, Let Us Refresh A Bit Oyo Rooms, Or Oyo Hotels Homes, Is An Indian Multinational Hospitality Chain That Has Leased And Franchised Hotels, Homes And Living Spaces Ritesh Agarwal Founded It In 2012, And In Its Earlier Days Primarily Started As Budget Hotels Oyo Has An Impressive Lineup Of Investors And Is Funded By 28 Investors The Latest To Join The Bandwagon Is Microsoft And Qatar Insurance Company In The Latest Round Of Funding, Oyo Has Raised A Total Of 4B In Funding Over 19 Rounds Their Latest Funding Was Raised On Jan 13, 2022, From A Secondary Market Round Oyo Has Acquired Eight Organizations Their Most Recent Acquisition Was Direct Booker On May 9, 2022Oyo Financed In Oyo Life On Oct 30, 2018 This Investment Funding Round Oyo Life Was Valued At 3B Huge Regular Fundings And Yet Losses However, Here Is Something That One Might Not Be Able To Digest, Despite The Excellent Round Of Funding That The Company Has Received And At Critical Moments In Time Oyo Is A Company That Has Consistently Registered Massive Losses Since The Company S Inception If Regular Reports That Have Come In The Market Are To Be Believed, Here Are The Statistics In Fy20 21, Oyo Incurred Losses Of Rs 3943 84, Which Decodes To A Loss Of Over Rs 76,077 Every Minute Oyo Has Been Continuously Reporting Losses, And Its Total Turnover Fell A Drastic 69% From Rs 13,413 Crore In 2020 To Rs 4,157 Crore In 2021 What Is Even More Stupendous Is That Despite These Losses, The Company S Management, Aka Ritesh Agarwal Wants To Go Public With The Company S Ipo, The Attempt Was Made In The Earlier Part Of 2021, And Now It Is Looking To Do So Again In 2023 Oyo S Ipo, A Disaster For Retail Investors This Is Perhaps The Most Significant Segment Of This Article Retail Investors An Ordinary Man Like You And Me Who Invest Their Hard Earned Money In Shares Of Companies That Are On A High, Hoping That Their Wealth Will Translate Into Ours Why Oyo S Ipo Is Scary, And The Founder Ritesh Agarwal Needs To Be Questioned On This Is That Despite All The Losses The Company Has Shown In Its Books, Why Does He Want The Retail Investors To Share The Losses Too What Has The Company Achieved Since Its Inception It Has Only Made News Controversies For Its Malpractices, Pathetic Layoffs, The Rooms Used For Unlawful Activities, And Fleecing Of Its Franchise Owners Does The Management Want Retail Investors To Partake In This Success Story Here Is Another Thing To Contemplate On Before You Make That Investment Fhrai, The Federal Hotel And Restaurant Association Of India, Has Brought To The Notice Of Sebi, The Securities Exchange Board Of India, To Call Off Oyo S Ipo It Stated That Sebi Needs To Look Into The Matter And Warned That Oyo S Ipo If Happens, Will Allegedly Wipe Out Public Wealth While Enriching Its Founders And Key Management Also, Take Into Account That It Has Been Reported That Oyo Has Stopped Operations Of Single Hotels And Has Become Just Another Online Travel Agent What Is Ritesh Agarwal S Ra Hospitality And The Cayman Islands Link As Early As 2019, It Was Reported In The Media That Ritesh Agarwal Had Set Up A Firm In The Cayman Islands In The Name Of Ra Hospitality As We All Know, Cayman Island Is A Tax Haven Tax Haven Is A Term Which Is Used For Those Countries That Provide Individuals Or Businesses Little Or No Tax Liability These Havens Are Chosen For The Very Element That They Offer Financial Privacy And Next To No Tax Liability The Cayman Islands Boasts Of Being One Of The Five Largest Offshore Financial Centres On The World Map It Provides Services Such As The Incorporation Of Offshore Companies, Offshore Trusts And Offshore Banking The Cayman Islands Also Has Strict Banking Laws Specifically Designed To Protect Banking Privacy Offshore Companies Registered Here Are Not Taxed On Income Earned Abroad As Well As No Taxation Of Cayman International Business Companies So Now That One Knows Of This Little Fact, Things Get Much Clearer The Simplicity But The Highly Strategic Move Provides A Telling Tale With All Is This The Route That Will Allow Funding To Flow Into Oyo Most Definitely, Yes, But Is This The Right Channel Or A Correct Business Move Ethically Perhaps, No Can It Be Questioned That Oyo Profits Are Parked In Ra Hospitality And Then Routed To Oyo Does This Rerouting Not Help In Inflating The Value Of The Company, And If The Ipo Was To Come Out, Would The Retail Investors Not Be Buying The Inflated Value Of The Shares Of The Company Whose Actual Worth May Be Questionable What S The Catch If The Oyo Is In Losses, Why Take Such Massive Salaries One Would Imagine That If A Founder Of A Company Is Operating With The Thought To Boost His Business And To Have A High Brand Value Not Marked With Controversies And Also With The Aim Of Valuing Its Shareholders , Then The Objective Would Be To Park As Many Funds As Possible Into The Business Exorbitant Salaries Can Be Taken If The Company Is Showing A Profit, Not When It Has Been Showing Losses Since Its Inception Furthermore, A Founder Of The Company Registers A Company In Tax Haven In The Cayman Islands, Which Protects His Financial Dealings And Can Be Used To Reroute Money Into The Company At Any Given Time Just To Attract Investors Or At The Time Of Issuing An Ipo Who Is Actually Funding The Company If The Oyo Ipo Comes Out With All The Above Points Mentioned, One Is Compelled To Think Who Is Really Going To Be Funding The Company And That Too At Higher Valuations That The Company Through Its Track Record Its Sketchy Operations Doesn T Deserve What If, At Some Point In Time, Ritesh Agarwal Sells His Stake In The Company And Exits Think Of The Massive Amount He May Have Acquired To His Name While The Retail Investors Will Be Stuck With Dud Shares Conclusion Ritesh Agarwal Is Undoubtedly A Shrewd Businessman Who, In Reality, Has Nothing To Show Off Regarding His Business Skills Since Its Inception, All The Company Has Been Doing Is Going Round And Round To Return To The Very Place It Started Nothing To Show In Terms Of Profits, Nothing To Offer In Terms Of Brand Value But A Company That Consistently Attracts Funding And Has Ready Investors A Company That Has Consistently Topped The Headlines For Entering Into One Controversy After Another, Showing Inflated Figures And Talking About How The Company Is Ready To Conquer The World Of Hospitality With Its Refined Business Strategies Undoubtedly, The Truth Of The Matter Is Entirely Different To The Projection Share This Twitterfacebooklike This Like Loading "," Retail Investors, Oyo, Oyo Hotels

Swamped At Work Since He Is Busy Working Through The Details Of An Upcoming Time Sensitive Dividend Declaration While It Made For A Casual Conversation, It Had Serious Unintended Consequences As Karan Worked For A Publicly Listed Company This Accidental Disclosure Was Treated As Unpublished Price Sensitive Information Under Sebi Act, 1992 And Invited A Show Cause Notice, Hefty Financial Penalty And An Embarrassing Corporate Governance Event Going Public Via An Initial Public Offering Ipo Is A Matter Of Great Pride For Entrepreneurs As They Become Esteemed Members Of An Exclusive Club Of Publicly Traded Companies 2021 Was A Bumper Year For Ipos, With 63 Companies Raising Rs 1 2 Lakh Crore, The Highest Ever Raised In A Single Year This Frenzy Is Expected To Sustain In 2022 Be That As It May, It Is Important To Understand That Underneath The Shiny Facade Of An Ipo Lies A Massive Shift In Statutory Obligations, Reporting Requirements, And Responsibilities Of The Connected Persons Including Founders, Promotors, Key Managerial Personnel, Designated Employees And Their Family Members The List Can Easily Be In Several Hundreds, If Not Thousands This List Works In Retrospect Too, Going Back Six Months To Establish Any Linkage Of A Connected Person With A Public Company To Instill Confidence, Trust And Integrity In The Securities Market, Sebi Has Taken Various Initiatives To Ensure Fair Market Conduct And Promulgated All Listed Companies To Comply With Several Regulations In Addition To The Companies Act, 2013 And Related Rules These Include Sebi Listing Obligations And Disclosure Requirements Regulations, 2015, Sebi Prohibition Of Insider Trading Regulations, 2015 And Various Other Circulars Issued By Sebi, Nse And Bse This Leads To An Addition Of Over 200 New Compliances On A Monthly, Quarterly And Annual Basis For Instance, A Listed Company Is Required To Observe A Silent Period From The End Of The Quarter To 48 Hours After The Declaration Of Quarterly Financial Results This Is Also Known As The Trading Window Closure Period Or Blackout Period During This Time, All Connected Persons And Those Privy To Company Information Are Prohibited From Trading In The Securities Of The Company And No Qualitative Or Quantitative Information Can Be Revealed This Includes Discussion On Financial Performance, Earnings Expectations, Hiring Plans, Changes To Board Or Key Managerial Personnel, Investment Plans, Among Others The Company Executives, Key Managerial Personnel, And Designated Employees Need To Observe Extreme Caution While Speaking In Public Or Private Events Accidental Leakage Of Any Unpublished Price Sensitive Information Can Put The Company On The Wrong Side Of The Law During This Time, The Mantra Is Refrain Or Face A Report If One Fails To Hold Back Any Unpublished Price Sensitive Information, There Is A Strong Likelihood Of Being Reported To The Watchdogs By Various Intermediaries And Agencies The Disclosure Of Any Information That Is Material Enough To Influence The Price Of The Scrip And Is Not Accessible To General Public Shareholders Should Be Prevented At All Costs Perhaps The Most Cumbersome Aspect Of Becoming A Listed Company Is That The Onus Of Compliance Spreads Over A Wide Array Of Employees Within The Organization All Connected Persons Of The Company Must Adhere To The Strict Requirements Of The Blackout Period Company S Bankers, Lawyers, Vendors, Tax Consultants, Auditors And Their Immediate Family Members Are All Subject To Statutory Restrictions As Well In The Event Of Volatile Price Movements Of The Scrip In The

Managing High Standards Of Corporate Governance Periodic Sensitisation And Structured Education On Compliance Obligations And Repercussions Of Inadvertent Leaks Through Online Platforms, Workshops, Seminars And Familiarization Programs Is Key In Addition, The Company Must Have Strong Internal Controls To Stay On Top Of The Changing Requirements Of The Statutory Environment And Flagging
